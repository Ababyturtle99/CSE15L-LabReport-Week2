Here I will show some ways to help optimize running commands, including setting an SSH key, and optimizing how you can run commands.

# SSH Keys

Creating and using an SSH key properly can help you run commands faster by not requiring you to put in your password every time you wish to log in on the computer which you created the key on.

Now that you can connect to the remote host faster, let's optimize our commands just a little bit. First you can connect to the remote host, run any command from there, and them immediately exit it by inputting a command as such:

Make sure to put the command you want to run in quotes!
