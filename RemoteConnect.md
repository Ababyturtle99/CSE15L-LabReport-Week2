# Connecting Remotely

In this class you will need to connect to a remote computer on campus. Here is where I will show you how to do this.

First you will need to install OpenSSH, which a good tutorial can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse).

After this, you will need to get your specific CSE15L remote account from this site [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).
It will look something like this: 

cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu

The first 5 characters will be the same as the example above, along with everything including and after the @. Copy that, as it will be important for logging in remotely.

After that's done, open up Visual Studio and a terminal, then type the command

*ssh (your remote account from above)*
