# Commands and More

This section will cover 3 things, trying new commands, copying files over, and setting an SSH key.

# A Few Basic Commands

Feel free to mess around and use these commands yourself to try to get familiar with them!

ls = lists files

pwd = shows the directory of the current file

mkdir (folder name) = make a new folder in that directory

cp (File) = copy a file over

cd (directory) = change directory to the directory provided in the argument
cd ~ = ~ is short for home in this case, and will take you to the home folder

It's possible to also run commands while connected to the server, although the files must be on the remote server.
You can do this how you would normally do so, such as running javac file.java then java file

# Copying Files Over
